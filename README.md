Node.JS Game Server
===================

This project aim to create an easy to use multiplayer game server. Suitable with HTML5 Websocket, Unity3D, Flash, C++/OpenGL/DirectX, XNA clients,...
Programmers onlyhave to implement gameplay logic which will be run in each game room and don't have to care much about the core server.
The Core Server is a room-based multiplayer system that enable players connect, chat in Global Lobby, join/create room, chat in rooms.

## Usage

You only have to run the **server.js** to run game server. And write game logic code in **room.js**

## Writing Game Logic

Room Logic will be implemented in **run()** method of the file: **room.js** like this:
```javascript
function run(room, player, msg)
{
	// Implement your game room (server side) logic here
	console.log("Processing " + player.name + "@" + room.name + ": " + msg);
}
```
With **room**: is the current game room. **player**: is the current player who sending message. **msg**: is the message sent from player.

## Core Server Messages

The list below is the messages defined and used by Core Server. You need this to implement some feature (join room, create room, chat,...) in client-side

	RECEIVE: 	
	 [CONNECTED;<player-name>]		(Everyone except sender)
	
2) Player disconnected from server
